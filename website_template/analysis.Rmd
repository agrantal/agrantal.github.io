## Load and Tidy Data 

Use one of the following datasets, and load from the p8105.datasets package: Instacart, NY NOAA, or NYC Restaurant Inspections. These datasets are large; you may want / need to filter or randomly sample from the complete dataset to ensure a reasonable product. 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(viridis)
library(p8105.datasets)
library(plotly)
set.seed(1)
p8105.datasets::instacart
```
???
sample only 5000 bc otherwise dataset is cumbersome -- sample_n(5000)
???

```{r}
insta = instacart %>% 
    janitor::clean_names() %>%
    select(department, days_since_prior_order) %>%
    filter(department == "produce" | department == "meat seafood" | department == "dairy eggs" | department == "international" | department == "pantry" | department == "snacks" | department == "canned goods" | department == "alcohol" | department == "bakery" | department == "babies" | department == "breakfast" |  department == "frozen" |  department == "bulk" | department == "dry goods pasta" | department == "beverages" |  department == "deli") %>%
    group_by(department) %>%
    summarise(mean = mean(days_since_prior_order)) %>%
    plot_ly(x = ~department, y = ~mean, type = "bar", mode = "markers", 
            alpha = 0.5)
insta

#what about text_label???
#what about normal labeling of axes and title? 
#also change so departments are in descending 
```

plot location (latitude and longitude) of the rentals in our dataset, and mapping price to color. We also define a new variable text_label and map that to text.
```{r}
nyc_airbnb %>%
  mutate(text_label = str_c("Price: $", price, '\nRating: ', rating)) %>% 
  plot_ly(x = ~longitude, y = ~latitude, type = "scatter", mode = "markers",
          alpha = 0.5, 
          color = ~price,
          text = ~text_label)
```


to show neighborhoods with the most rentals
```{r}
#boxplot 
common_neighborhoods =
  nyc_airbnb %>% 
  count(neighbourhood, sort = TRUE) %>% 
  top_n(8) %>% 
  select(neighbourhood)
## Selecting by n

inner_join(nyc_airbnb, common_neighborhoods,
             by = "neighbourhood") %>% 
  mutate(neighbourhood = fct_reorder(neighbourhood, price)) %>% 
  plot_ly(y = ~price, color = ~neighbourhood, type = "box",
          colors = "Set2")

#barchart
nyc_airbnb %>% 
  count(neighbourhood) %>% 
  mutate(neighbourhood = fct_reorder(neighbourhood, n)) %>% 
  plot_ly(x = ~neighbourhood, y = ~n, color = ~neighbourhood, type = "bar")
